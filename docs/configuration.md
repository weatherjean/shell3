# Configuration

Everything shell3 does is decided by one file: `shell3.lua`. It's plain Lua, so
it's versionable, diffable, and programmable — you configure shell3 like
software, not like a platform with a settings panel.

`shell3 boot` writes a working config for you. This page is for when you want to
go beyond the defaults: add a model, write a tool, gate the shell, or understand
how shell3 finds your config in the first place.

## Where the config lives

`boot` creates three things under `~/.shell3/`:

- `shell3.lua` — the config: your models, the agent, subagents, tools, and skills.
- `lib/` — tool modules the config `require`s and `lib/skills/` markdown skills.
- `.env` — your secrets (API keys, tokens). **Never commit this file.**

### How the config path is resolved

The `--config` / `-c` flag takes a **name**, not a path — unless it ends in
`.lua`:

| You pass | shell3 loads |
|----------|--------------|
| *(nothing)* | `~/.shell3/shell3.lua` |
| `-c code` | `~/.shell3/code.lua` |
| `-c ./my.lua` | that literal file |

The current working directory is never consulted for config. This keeps a
session's behavior predictable no matter where you launch it from.

## Models

A model is an endpoint plus the parameters shell3 should send it. Any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint works:

```lua
shell3.model("main", {
  base_url       = "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  api_key        = shell3.env.secret("MAIN_API_KEY"),  -- read from .env
  model          = "gpt-5.2",
  context_window = 128000,   -- the model's real token budget
  compact_at     = 100000,   -- auto-compact threshold (see below); 0 = off
  -- reasoning   = "medium", -- if the model supports reasoning effort
})
```

Set `context_window` to the model's *actual* budget — the wrong number throws
off the context-usage reminders and the compaction trigger.

`compact_at` is an absolute prompt-token threshold. When a turn's prompt crosses
it, shell3 summarizes the head of the conversation and keeps a verbatim recent
tail — so the model retains its immediate working context. This is
host-managed: there are no model-driven prune or compact tools to call. Leave
it unset (or `0`) to disable.

Two optional knobs tune the compaction policy:

```lua
shell3.model("main", {
  compact_at   = 100000,  -- full tail-preserving compaction
  keep_recent  = 33000,   -- verbatim tail size (tokens); default round(compact_at * 0.33)
  prune_at     = 60000,   -- lower threshold: stubs old tool outputs, no LLM call
                          --   default round(compact_at * 0.6); 0 = disabled
})
```

`keep_recent` controls how many recent prompt tokens are preserved verbatim
across a compaction. Only the head (everything before that boundary) is
summarized. Defaults to `round(compact_at * 0.33)`; clamped to
`round(compact_at * 0.5)` if you set it at or above `compact_at`.

`prune_at` is a cheaper first response: when the prompt crosses this lower
threshold shell3 stubs old tool outputs inline (no LLM call needed), buying
room before a full compaction is required. Defaults to
`round(compact_at * 0.6)`; set to `0` to skip this tier entirely. Ignored if
set at or above `compact_at`.

### Provider-specific knobs

Some providers want a non-standard request field shell3 doesn't model directly.
The `extra` table is the escape hatch — its keys are injected verbatim into the
top-level request JSON:

```lua
extra = { reasoning_split = true },           -- MiniMax: route thinking to reasoning_content
extra = { verbosity = "high" },               -- gpt-5-style verbosity
extra = { provider = { order = {"anthropic"} } },  -- OpenRouter routing (nested objects work)
```

Only set `extra` when you need it — strict endpoints reject unknown fields. See
[cookbook/models.md](cookbook/models.md) for more.

### Local proxies (`run_proxy`)

If a model needs a shim in front of its endpoint — say a Codex subscription
fronted by `npx`, or a litellm gateway — set `run_proxy`. shell3 starts that
command (detached, fire-and-forget) the first time an agent uses the model, and
logs go to `~/.shell3/proxy-<model>.log`:

```lua
shell3.model("codex", {
  run_proxy = "npx @some/codex-proxy --port 8787",
  base_url  = "http://localhost:8787/v1",
  -- ...
})
```

If a proxy is already listening, the spawn just fails to bind and the first
request proceeds against whatever is there. See
[cookbook/proxy.md](cookbook/proxy.md).

## The agent

An agent is a name, a model, a system prompt, and a set of tools. **Exactly one
`shell3.agent({...})` may be declared** — a second declaration fails the load.
Specialists are [subagents](#subagents--delegation), spawned by the agent as
background jobs; see
[cookbook/lib/extra-agents.lua](cookbook/lib/extra-agents.lua).

```lua
shell3.agent({
  name   = "code",
  model  = "main",
  prompt = [[You are a careful pair-programmer…]],
  tools  = {
    bash      = true,
    bash_bg   = true,   -- background / long-running work
    edit      = true,   -- the edit_file tool
    media     = true,   -- inbound/outbound images + audio
    custom    = { my_tool },          -- Lua-defined tools (below)
    subagents = { explorer },         -- delegatable specialists
  },
  skills = { "lib/skills" },                  -- skill directories (below)
})
```

There are **no file-read tools**: the agent reads with `cat`/`sed -n`, lists
with `ls`/`find`, and searches with `rg` — all through `bash` (hallucinated
`read`/`grep` calls are redirected, see [stub tools](#stub-tools)). A
*read-only* agent is a policy, not a tool set: gate `bash` in
[`on_tool_call`](#the-command-gate--on_tool_call) to inspection-only commands.

## Subagents & delegation

A subagent is a delegatable specialist: declared with `shell3.subagent({...})`
instead of `shell3.agent({...})` — only an agent that lists it under
`tools.subagents` may spawn it. The shape is the same as
an agent's (name, model, prompt, tools) plus a `description`, which is what the
parent model reads when deciding what to delegate. Subagent names are
deduplicated rather than rejected: agents and subagents share one namespace, so
a second entry named `explorer` auto-suffixes to `explorer2` (then
`explorer3`, …) while the first keeps its bare name.

```lua
local explorer = shell3.subagent({
  name        = "explorer",
  description = "Read-only investigation of the codebase. No edits.",
  model       = "main",
  prompt      = [[You are a focused code explorer…]],
  tools       = { bash = true },
})

shell3.agent({
  name       = "code",
  delegation = true,                      -- advertise the task tools
  tools      = { subagents = { explorer } },  -- who this agent may spawn
  -- ...
})
```

When an agent sets **both** `delegation = true` and a non-empty
`tools.subagents` list, shell3 advertises four tools to it — `task` (spawn one:
`{subagent_type, prompt, description}`; returns immediately), `task_list`,
`task_status <id>`, and `task_cancel <id>`. The allowed subagents — names plus
their `description`s — are baked into the `task` tool's own schema (an enum on
`subagent_type`), so the model learns what it may spawn from the tool itself;
no per-turn reminder is injected. One toggle without the other advertises
nothing.

A spawned subagent runs as an **in-process background job** — a child-session
goroutine, not a subprocess — and on completion the parent is woken with a
capped result summary injected into its context. Subagents run headless (an
`{ask=...}` gate verdict is auto-denied; see
[the gate section](#deny-prompt-confirmation-and-headless-degradation)), and
delegation is single-level by construction: a subagent is never given the
`task` tool, so it cannot spawn subagents of its own.

One optional config-global knob caps the machinery:

```lua
shell3.background({ max_concurrent = 8 })  -- concurrent background jobs (default 8)
```

The same job runtime backs `bash_bg`, which is gated separately by
`tools = { bash_bg = true }` — not by `delegation`. A `bash_bg` job that exits
**nonzero** wakes an idle agent so the failure is narrated proactively; a clean
exit queues its notice quietly for the next turn.

**Subagents and `bash_bg`.** A subagent's still-running `bash_bg` job keeps
its session open past its main turn; each completion **resumes** the subagent
for a follow-up turn whose summary reaches the main agent as a notice (capped
at 5 per subagent — past the cap, or after cancel, the raw job notice is
delivered instead, so no completion is lost). `task_cancel <sub-id>` cascades
to the jobs that subagent started.

## Custom tools

A custom tool is **not** a Lua function — it's a bash command template. You give
it a name, a JSON schema for its parameters, and a command. Declared parameters
arrive in the command's environment as lowercase `$`-named variables; declared
`secrets` are exported too (and kept out of the command string). The command's
stdout is what the model sees.

```lua
local weather = shell3.tool({
  name        = "weather",
  description = "Current weather for a city.",
  parameters  = {
    type       = "object",
    properties = { city = { type = "string", description = "City name." } },
    required   = { "city" },
  },
  secrets = { "WEATHER_API_KEY" },           -- exported as $WEATHER_API_KEY
  command = [[
curl -sf -G "https://api.example.com/v1/current" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WEATHER_API_KEY" \
  --data-urlencode "q=$city" \
| jq -r '.location.name + ": " + (.current.temp_c|tostring) + "°C"'
]],
})
```

Two habits keep tools safe and tidy: use `curl --data-urlencode` for any
user-supplied parameter (never interpolate model text straight into a URL), and
shape the output with `jq` so you return a clean line, not a wall of JSON.

Optional fields: `background = true` (runs the command as an in-process
background job, like `bash_bg`: it shows up in the dashboard's jobs view and the
agent is notified with a completion notice on a later turn) and
`timeout = N` (seconds; foreground tools only). See [cookbook/lib/tools.lua](cookbook/lib/tools.lua) for a full
template, including the `web_fetch` and `brave_search` tools the base config
ships with.

> **A note on secrets:** declared `secrets` are passed via the command's process
> environment. On a shared host, same-user processes can read another process's
> environment (`/proc/<pid>/environ` on Linux). That's fine for a local,
> single-user setup; on a multi-user box, treat tool secrets as readable by
> anything that user can run. More in [security.md](security.md).

## Opt-in command gate — `on_tool_call`

shell3 is **unsafe by default**: bash commands run with no restrictions.
`on_tool_call` fires before **every** tool the model calls — `bash`, `bash_bg`,
`edit_file`, `read_media`, and custom tools — and the
handler decides per tool by switching on `t.name`. It is off until you register it;
a fresh config gates nothing. `t.command` carries the bash command for the two
bash tools and is **nil** for everything else, so a denylist that matches
`t.command` must first check `t.name` (see the idiom below). Handlers are
**chainable** — multiple `on_tool_call` calls run in declaration order; the first
**terminal** verdict wins.

### The `t` event

Each handler receives a table `t`:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `t.name` | The **real** tool name: `"bash"`, `"bash_bg"`, `"edit_file"`, `"read_media"`, or a custom tool's name. |
| `t.command` | The bash command string — only for the two bash tools; **nil** for every other tool. |
| `t.args` | Raw arguments JSON string (every tool). Gate a non-bash tool by inspecting this, e.g. an `edit_file` path. |
| `t.headless` | `true` when no human asker is attached to the session (in-process subagents, cron jobs) — an `{ask=...}` verdict would auto-deny there. Independent of `disable_safety`. See [headless degradation](#deny-prompt-confirmation-and-headless-degradation). |

### Verdict contract

A handler returns one of:

| Return value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `nil` | Pass; continue to the next handler (or run). |
| `{ command = "..." }` | Rewrite the bash command text; continue the chain. **Bash tools only** — on a non-bash tool this fails closed. |
| `{ argv = { ... } }` | **Terminal**: exec this argv exactly (runner swap). **`bash`/`bash_bg` only** — non-bash tools fail closed. |
| `{ block = true, reason = "..." }` | **Terminal**: block; `reason` is surfaced to the model. Works for any tool. |
| `{ ask = "prompt", reason = "...", ask_timeout = N }` | Prompt a human; allowed → run, declined/headless → block with `reason`. Works for any tool. `ask_timeout` optional (seconds, default 300). |

A handler that raises a Lua error **fails closed** (blocks). Only `{block=true}`
blocks via the block verdict; a returned table that contains none of the recognized
keys (`block`/`argv`/`ask`/`command`) fails closed (is blocked) as a safety
default; return `nil` to pass.

### Writing a denylist with `shell3.regex`

`shell3.regex(pattern)` compiles a Go RE2 pattern **at config load** — a bad
pattern is a load error, never a runtime surprise. Returns an object with
`:match(s) -> bool (unanchored)`.

Recommended idiom for a hard-block / ask-human denylist:

```lua
local re   = shell3.regex
-- (?s) so .* spans newlines; match t.command (the whole string) so
-- chaining can't hide a flagged fragment behind a benign prefix.
local HARD = { re([[(?s)rm\s+-rf\s+/]]), re([[(?s)mkfs]]), re([[(?s)dd\s+if=]]) }
local ASK  = { re([[(?s)rm\s+-rf]]), re([[(?s)\bgit\s+push]]), re([[(?s)curl\b.*\|\s*(ba)?sh]]) }
local ENV  = re([[\.env]]) -- hoisted like the lists above: compiled once at load

shell3.on_tool_call(function(t)
  -- Gate the bash family. This guard is REQUIRED: t.command is nil for non-bash
  -- tools, so matching it without the check would error (→ fail closed).
  if t.name == "bash" or t.name == "bash_bg" then
    for _, p in ipairs(HARD) do
      if p:match(t.command) then return { block = true, reason = "hard_deny" } end
    end
    for _, p in ipairs(ASK) do
      if p:match(t.command) then
        -- Headless (subagent / cron job): an ask would auto-deny anyway,
        -- so block with a reason the parent agent can act on.
        if t.headless then return { block = true, reason = "needs approval; rerun interactively" } end
        return { ask = "Run?\n" .. t.command, reason = "denied" }
      end
    end
  end
  -- Other tools fall through to nil (run). Gate them by name + args if you want,
  -- e.g. refuse to edit the secrets file:
  if t.name == "edit_file" and ENV:match(t.args) then
    return { block = true, reason = "no editing .env" }
  end
end)
```

Because the gate sees every tool, the same hook can enforce things like "never
read `.env`" or "no `edit_file` under `/etc`" — match on `t.name` and `t.args`.
`{command}`/`{argv}` rewrites only make sense for the bash family, so returning one
for a non-bash tool fails closed.

> **No implicit `(?s)`.** `shell3.regex` does not prepend `(?s)` automatically —
> add it yourself on patterns where `.*` must span newlines. `^`/`$` anchor to the
> start/end of the whole command (not each line); prefer `\b`-anchored fragments
> (`\bgit\s+push`) over `^`/`$` unless you specifically mean the command's ends.

### Deny-prompt confirmation and headless degradation

When a handler returns `{ask=...}`, a human must confirm. **The bot shows inline
Allow/Deny buttons in the chat**. **Headless subagents and cron jobs** have no attached human, so an `{ask=...}` verdict
is auto-denied with its `reason`; the block reason flows back to the parent agent
in the in-process completion notice so the parent — where a human *is* attached — can decide
how to proceed. Handlers see this ahead of time as `t.headless` and can return a
tailored `{block=...}` (or allow a safe subset) instead of an ask that will never
be answered. A prompt nobody answers falls back to deny after the timeout
(`ask_timeout`, default 300 s). `{block=true}` never prompts — it blocks
everywhere, headless or not.

Because there's no allowlist, ordinary reads (`cat`, `rg`, `ls`, …) match no
pattern and just run — a headless subagent explores freely. Only commands you
explicitly gate in a handler are affected.

### Runner swap (container, SSH, firejail)

The `{ argv = { ... } }` verdict lets you choose the program that runs the
agent's command — the command arrives as one argv element so nothing re-parses or
re-quotes it:

```lua
shell3.on_tool_call(function(t)
  -- Wrap every bash command in the container.
  if t.name == "bash" or t.name == "bash_bg" then
    return { argv = {"docker", "exec", "mycontainer", "bash", "-c", t.command} }
  end
end)
```

A malformed argv table (empty, or any non-string element) fails **closed**: the
command is blocked, never run unwrapped. A custom
command-template tool's command is your trusted template (not model input), so it is
never rewritten — but the tool **call** still fires `on_tool_call` (by its name, with
`t.command` nil), so you can `block`/`ask` it. The full recipe set is in
[cookbook/sandbox.md](cookbook/sandbox.md).

### Tool-result rewriting — `on_tool_result`

The symmetric post-execution hook `shell3.on_tool_result(fn)` runs after a tool
produces output. Like `on_tool_call`, it fires for **every** tool, and `r.name` is
the real tool name — `"bash"`, `"bash_bg"`, `"read"`, `"edit_file"`, or a custom
tool's name. The
handler receives `r` with `r.name`, `r.args` (raw arguments JSON), and `r.output`.
Return `{ output = "..." }` to replace what the model sees; return `nil` to pass
through unchanged. Primary use: secret redaction — for which you usually want to
cover all output, not just one tool:

```lua
shell3.on_tool_result(function(r)
  return { output = (r.output:gsub("API_KEY=%S+", "API_KEY=[redacted]")) }
end)
```

Errors in `on_tool_result` handlers fail **open** — a broken result-rewriter
must not destroy tool output — so they are logged and the original passes through.
(Contrast `on_tool_call`, which fails closed: blocking is safe, silently nuking
output is not.) The flip side: if your redactor errors, the **unredacted** output
reaches the model, so keep redaction handlers simple and total.

## Redirecting hallucinated tools — `stub_tools`

shell3 has no file-read tools, and models trained on other harnesses
reflexively reach for `read`, `read_file`, `grep`, or `write_file`. Register
those names as stubs and shell3 returns a one-line redirect instead of erroring
— a self-correcting nudge back to bash and `edit_file`:

```lua
shell3.stub_tools({
  read       = "Use bash: cat <path>, or sed -n 'START,ENDp' <path> for a slice.",
  read_file  = "Use bash: cat <path>.",
  list_files = "Use bash: ls <dir> or find <dir> -maxdepth 2.",
  grep       = "Use bash: rg <pattern>.",
  write_file = "Use edit_file (empty old_string creates/overwrites).",
})
```

The scaffold ships this block enabled. Stubs are config-global (every agent
sees them). Later keys override earlier ones, and a stub whose name collides
with a real tool is ignored.

## Telegram host — `shell3.telegram`

shell3 runs as a Telegram bot; `shell3.telegram{}` configures it. The bot
answers exactly one `chat_id` and runs the one configured agent (which may
spawn subagents).

```lua
shell3.telegram({
  token   = shell3.env.secret("TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"),  -- from @BotFather, in .env
  chat_id = "8701499393",                             -- the one chat the bot answers
  workdir = "/home/me/.shell3/workdir",               -- "" → the runtime root
  dashboard = {
    enabled = true,
    addr    = "127.0.0.1:8765",
    tunnel  = "cloudflared tunnel --url http://{addr}",  -- the scaffold default (see below)
    -- url  = "https://…",                               -- optional fixed address
  },
})
```

- **`token` / `chat_id`** are required. Keep the token in `.env` and reference it
  with `shell3.env.secret`. Only messages from `chat_id` are handled.
- **`dashboard`** serves the Mini App over HTTP on `addr`. Give it a public
  `https` address and the bot **wires the chat's menu button to it
  automatically** (`setChatMenuButton` — no BotFather step):
  - **`tunnel`** is a shell command shell3 spawns detached at start, with
    `{addr}` replaced by the dashboard addr; the first bare `https://…` URL it
    prints is used. The scaffolded default, `cloudflared tunnel --url
    http://{addr}`, works with zero account but requires
    [`cloudflared`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) to be installed
    (e.g. `brew install cloudflared` on macOS) — swap the command for any
    tunnel that prints an https URL, or delete the line to stay local-only.
    Output goes to `~/.shell3/tunnel.log`; if no URL appears within 30s (e.g.
    the binary is missing) the bot still runs and the dashboard just stays
    local.
  - **`url`** is a fixed public address you run yourself (a stable tunnel,
    `tailscale serve`). It overrides `tunnel`.
  - Leave both empty to reach the dashboard only locally (or with
    `shell3 dash`).

## Standalone web front-end — `shell3.web`

`shell3.web{}` configures `shell3 web`: the same dashboard plus a simple chat,
served over plain HTTP with a shared secret instead of Telegram. It is the
Telegram-free fallback — it resumes the latest stored session, so a
conversation started over Telegram continues in the browser.

```lua
shell3.web({
  addr   = "127.0.0.1:8787",
  secret = shell3.env.secret("SHELL3_WEB_SECRET"),       -- required; keep it in .env
  tunnel = "cloudflared tunnel --url http://{addr}",     -- optional public https URL
  -- url = "https://…",                                  -- optional fixed address (wins over tunnel)
})
```

- **`addr` / `secret`** are required (`shell3 web` refuses to start without
  them — an empty secret never means "no auth"). Generate one with
  `openssl rand -hex 24` and put it in `.env` as `SHELL3_WEB_SECRET=…`.
- **Auth**: open `http://<addr>/?key=<secret>` once; the page stores the key
  and sends it as an `X-Auth-Token` header from then on. Every `/api/*`
  endpoint is gated on it (constant-time compare).
- **`tunnel` / `url`** have the same semantics as the Telegram dashboard's
  (tunnel command spawned at start, `{addr}` replaced, first printed
  `https://…` used; output in `~/.shell3/tunnel.log`).
- **Chat**: the dashboard's Chat tab gains a send box, a Stop button, and
  Allow/Deny cards for `on_tool_call` asks. Replies arrive by polling — a
  deliberately simple fallback transport. The bot's slash commands work here
  too (`/stop`, `/clear`, `/set`, `/rollback`, `/run <job>`, `/reload`, plus a
  web-only `/help`); command replies render as ephemeral notices, not history.
- Declared `shell3.cron` jobs keep running under `shell3 web`; the heartbeat
  does not (it's a Telegram-notification feature).
- Run **one front-end at a time** — `shell3 telegram` and `shell3 web` own the
  same runs store and history.

## Scheduled jobs — `shell3.cron`

`shell3.cron({...})` is a top-level flat list of jobs. Each fires a subagent
(`agent` must name a declared subagent) on `schedule` (a cron expression or
`@daily`/`@hourly`/…). The scheduler runs inside `shell3 telegram`.

```lua
shell3.cron({
  { name = "daily", schedule = "@daily", agent = "explorer", notify = true,
    prompt = "Summarize anything noteworthy from the last day." },
})
```

`notify = true` wakes the chat with the result; `notify = false` delivers it
quietly for the agent's next turn. Arm a changed cron list with `/reload`; run
a job on demand with `/run <name>`.

## Heartbeat — `shell3.heartbeat`

Where cron fires a **fresh, contextless subagent** at an exact time, the
heartbeat periodically wakes the **main session** — full conversation context —
with an open-ended "anything need attention?" checklist, and stays silent
unless something does. Use it for standing awareness (inbox, calendar, "did
anything break?", following up on work the agent promised); use cron for
exact-time, isolated jobs.

```lua
shell3.heartbeat({
  every     = "30m",                 -- required; a Go duration ("30m", "1h")
  checklist = [[
- anything urgent in the inbox?
- any background work you promised earlier and haven't finished?
]],                                  -- required; the standing orders each tick carries
  active    = { from = "08:00", to = "23:00", tz = "Europe/Berlin" },
  -- prompt = "...",                 -- optional preamble override (checklist is still appended)
})
```

Mechanics: each tick that lands while the session is **idle** and inside the
`active` window injects the checklist prompt as a queued turn (the same wake
path background-job notices use). The prompt instructs the model to reply
exactly `HEARTBEAT_OK` when nothing needs attention; the bot strips that
sentinel and sends nothing, so the chat only hears real alerts. Busy or
out-of-window ticks are **skipped, not queued** — heartbeat timing is
approximate by design. Declaring a second `shell3.heartbeat` fails the load.

- `active` is optional (omit for 24/7); `from` is inclusive, `to` exclusive,
  both `"HH:MM"` 24h clock, and `from > to` spans midnight (`22:00`–`06:00`).
- `tz` is an IANA zone name for the window, defaulting to the host's local
  zone; it is validated at load time.
- `/reload` picks up heartbeat changes (a removed block stops the ticking).
- The dashboard's Status view shows the declared heartbeat — interval, active
  window, checklist — and whether the running front-end actually arms it
  (only `shell3 telegram` ticks; under `shell3 web`/`dash` it shows as inert).
- Test a checklist end-to-end with `shell3 dev --heartbeat`: it fires one tick
  and prints whether the reply would be suppressed or delivered.

## Skills

A skill is a plain `.md` file the agent reads with `cat` when it's relevant —
there is no `skill` tool and no Lua declaration. An agent lists directories
(`skills = { "lib/skills" }`, resolved relative to `shell3.lua`), and every
`*.md` inside (non-recursive) becomes one skill. A file is markdown with YAML
frontmatter — a required `description` (the one-liner the agent sees and uses
to decide whether to read the body) and an optional `name` defaulting to the
filename:

```markdown
---
description: Planning + approval gate before any non-trivial change.
---
When asked for a non-trivial change, first...
```

Adding a skill is dropping a file into a listed dir and `/reload`-ing. A
missing directory fails the load; a file the loader can't use (no
frontmatter/`description`, empty body, duplicate name) is skipped with a
warning — `shell3 health` turns those warnings into hard errors. Granted
skills are indexed by absolute path in the system prompt under `## Skills`;
the [cookbook](cookbook/) ships ready-to-use ones.

## Putting it together

For a full example, read the base config `boot` writes —
`~/.shell3/shell3.lua`. For drop-in additions (extra subagents, more skills, the
browser skill, proxy and sandbox setups), see the
[cookbook](cookbook/README.md).
